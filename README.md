I'm gonna try and make some of those beautiful ideas from r/shittymcsuggestions (and some other equivalents).

Yeah that's right, now I'm not going to do everything, some suggestions are far to... perplexing?, anyways Ima try and big cheese it.
Your free to use any file here however you want, that is my intention after all.

Put [DarkAtham Comp1_13] into your Datapacks folder and use what files that you want in there.
Just put the command, [function darkathame_comp1_13:masterloop], on whatever loop you have to get things going.

Use the hashtags to enable/disable functions in the Master Loop.
Some files may have a Int (install) and a Unint (uninstall) function file, these are used to activate/deactivate things like scoreboards, so make sure to use them!

All modules have a .txt explaining what they do (sometimes), who suggested the idea, and any non-function files they use, mainly .json files.

Now with advancements!
