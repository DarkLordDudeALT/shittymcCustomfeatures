Your Free To Use Any File Here However You Want, That Is My Intention After All.

Put [DarkAtham Comp1_13] Into Your Datapacks Folder And Use What Files That You Want In There.
Just Put The Command [function darkathame_comp1_13:masterloop] On Whatever Loop You Have, To Get Things Going.

Use The Hashtags To Enable/Disable Functions In The Master Loop.
Some Files May Have A Int (Install) And A Unint (Uninstall) Function File, These Are Used To Activate/Deactivate Things Like Scoreboards, So Make Sure To Use Them!

Now With Advancements
